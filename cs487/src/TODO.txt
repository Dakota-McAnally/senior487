Make 3 ore types useful --> there cant be copper ore that becomes obsolete, because whats the point of adding it --> Maybe the player can choose which ore to mine? 

Upgrade Shop should reflect Ore related upgrades costing Ore, not coins

Upgrade Shop should allow players to buy ore upgrades and actually apply --> and persist level/cost to DB

Implement some form of crafting --> Player can craft sword/pickaxe using coins + ore (copper -> iron -> gold)

Each tool/weapon should have a base damage value that is used instead of player.dps (mining and combat use the same right now, shouldnt be the case)

Add tooltips to the things that need explaining (Upgrades/Crafting/Tools/Inventory Items?)
